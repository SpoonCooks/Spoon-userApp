/**
 * Booking data.
 *
 * ## The dev-id seam
 *
 * `DEMO_VIEWS` is keyed by the DEV route names (`enRoute`, `arrived`, …) that the review menu
 * navigates to. A real booking id is a UUID and can never collide with one, so the two paths are
 * disjoint by construction — and the whole fixture branch is behind `__DEV__`, so a release build
 * only ever has the API path.
 *
 * The fixtures are deliberately kept (§27): several lifecycle states are hard to reach on a real
 * backend — a cook must physically arrive, a service must run long — and they remain the fastest
 * way to review those designed screens. What they no longer do is stand in the way of real data.
 *
 * ## Not everything is wired, and the gaps are real
 *
 * `bookingDetailFrom` fills the status, the address, the price, the schedule rows and
 * `allowedActions` from the payload. The live half — the ETA and the SERVICE OTP the customer
 * reads out — is not on that payload; it comes from `GET /v1/bookings/:id/tracking` and is
 * layered on by `trackingDetailFrom`. Tracking is only polled in the states where the server has
 * anything to say, so a confirmed-but-not-yet-assigned booking makes no tracking request.
 */

/**
 * The designed COPY for each lifecycle view — not a data source.
 *
 * ## The defect this replaces
 *
 * This table used to be keyed by VIEW names (`confirmation`, `enRoute`, `arrived`, `completion`)
 * and indexed by BACKEND STATUSES (`created`, `assigned`, `cook_en_route`, `cook_arrived`,
 * `cooking`, `completed`, `cancelled`). Only `cancelled` collided, by accident. Every other real
 * booking missed and fell back to the confirmation copy, so:
 *
 *   `cook_en_route`  drew Confirmation instead of En route — no ETA, no tracking body
 *   `cook_arrived`   drew Confirmation instead of Arrived  — no Start OTP, no Start Service
 *   `cooking`        was explicitly rewritten to `enRoute`  — no timer, no End OTP, no Extend
 *   `completed`      drew Confirmation instead of Completion — no rating, no tip
 *
 * and because the confirmation copy carries none of `tracking` / `arrived` / `inService` /
 * `completion`, the host's `switch` then hit its `undefined` guard and rendered the generic
 * "This booking is being updated" fallback. Every live booking landed there.
 *
 * ## What it is keyed by now
 *
 * The RESOLVED VIEW, from `viewForBooking` — the same pure function `bookingDetailFrom` calls with
 * the same inputs, so the copy and the view can never disagree. The two payload facts that a
 * status alone cannot express are inputs to it: `reassignment.occurred` (8a → 8b) and the SERVER's
 * `timingVerdict` (9a → 9b, 10a → 10b), which selects between the two drawn punctuality variants
 * rather than the client comparing an ETA against its own clock.
 *
 * ## Why fixtures supply copy at all
 *
 * Banner titles, note text, CTA labels and section headings have no endpoint and are not domain
 * state. They were transcribed from the audited frames and live in `demo/fixtures` because that is
 * where the transcription is auditable against Figma. What the fixtures must NOT supply is
 * business truth, and `bookingDetailFrom` overwrites every such field — cook name, timer target,
 * arrival time, OTP digits, refund amount, schedule line — from the DTO before anything renders.
