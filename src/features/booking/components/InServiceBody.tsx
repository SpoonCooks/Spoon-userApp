/**
 * In service — Figma `101:1812`, and `292:1197` "Page 12b- Cooking extended".
 *
 * `101:1881` stacks its section boxes 16pt apart:
 *   status banner (`292:1035`) → [extended notice] → extension promo (`101:1857`) → End Service +
 *   End OTP (`292:1046`) → cook card (`292:1064`) → details row (`292:1188`).
 *
 * TWO corrections this pass: the frame draws **no "Note before starting" card** on In service —
 * the implementation rendered one — and it DOES draw the `250:2966` details row, which it did not.
 *
 * `292:1197` is this screen with ONE extra block: `292:1399`, a second, compact status banner
 * reading "Booking extended! / End time extended by 20 mins". Its presence is the SERVER
 * reporting the extension took effect; the new end time arrives with it and is never computed
 * from the chosen option.
 *
 * The banner is the SAME component as En route and Arrived — `101:1882` differs from `99:1610`
 * only in its 31pt glyph (a frying pan), its copy and the figure in the 117 × 103 panel. The
 * countdown occupies that panel.
 *
 * The countdown is PRESENTATION ONLY (FRONTEND_FOUNDATION_PLAN.md §19):
 *  - it derives from the server's absolute `endsAtMs`, corrected by the server-reported skew;
 *  - it recomputes on foreground rather than trusting a background timer;
 *  - reaching zero calls `onElapsed`, which REFETCHES authoritative state. It never ends the
 *    session, never advances the booking, and never decides anything.
 *
 * The End OTP is displayed for the user to read out. It is not verified here.
