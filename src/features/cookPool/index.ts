/**
 * Feature: Cook Pool — the household's preferred cooks (DEC-085). The landing shows the pool; the
 * deck adds cooks who have served the household by swiping; a cook's profile shows their menu and
 * can take them out of the pool. `CookPoolFlow` runs all three in one place for the dev preview,
 * over `createDemoCookPoolSource` in a `CookPoolSourceProvider`.
