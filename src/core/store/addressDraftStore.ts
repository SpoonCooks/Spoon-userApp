/**
 * The address being added, between the map step and the details step.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * `53:31` produces a POINT and `60:655` collects the rest of the address, and they are two
 * routes. The coordinates have to survive that navigation, and they are exactly what §20 permits
 * a client to own: a temporary pre-submit selection. The moment `POST /v1/me/addresses` succeeds
 * the server owns the address and this store is cleared — nothing here is ever read back as
 * though it were the saved address.
 *
 * ## What is authoritative and what is not
 *
 * `latitude`/`longitude` come from the device and ARE what gets saved; they are the reason this
 * store exists. `serviceable` is the SERVER's verdict for that point, carried forward only so
 * the details step does not offer to save a point the map step already learned is refused — it
 * is not re-derived here, and the create call is refused by the backend regardless.
 *
 * The geocoded strings are a PREFILL. The customer edits them, and the backend stores what they
 * submit; an OS geocoder's wording has no authority over anyone's address.
