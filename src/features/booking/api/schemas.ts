 * The assigned cook on `GET /v1/bookings/:id`.

 *
 * It read `id`, `name`, `photoUrl` and a numeric `rating`. The backend sends `cookId`,
 * `displayName`, `profileImageUrl` and `rating` as an OBJECT — `{ average, count }`. Three of
 * those mismatches would only have emptied the fields, because every one was optional and Zod
 * drops unknown keys. The fourth did far worse: an object where `z.number()` was expected is a
 * type error, not a missing value, so `bookingDetailSchema.parse` THREW on every booking that
 * had a cook.
 *
 * The blast radius was the whole detail read. `useBookingDetail` errored, `detailData` stayed
 * null, and Home — which builds its banner from the detail — silently drew the pre-booking
 * variant. A confirmed booking with a cook assigned to it produced no Upcoming banner at all,
 * and nothing on screen said why. The booking detail screen was unreachable for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why this normalises instead of renaming everywhere
 *
 * The output keeps the shape every existing reader already uses (`id`, `name`, `photoUrl`,
 * `rating`), so the fix lands entirely at the boundary — which is where a provider's field names
 * belong — rather than rippling through adapters and screens. Both spellings are accepted so the
 * app parses whether it is pointed at the current backend or an older deployment, and `rating`
 * takes either the object or a bare number for the same reason.
 *
 * `average` is what the card shows; `count` is carried through so a reader that wants "4.8 (312)"
 * does not need a second request.
