/**
 * Address and serviceability endpoints.

 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * Only CREATE requires an `Idempotency-Key` (the backend rejects it with INVALID_REQUEST
 * otherwise); update and delete are naturally idempotent and demand none. The key is scoped to
 * the PAYLOAD, so a retry after an ambiguous timeout replays the same intent instead of creating
 * a second address, while an edited form starts a genuinely new one — see `addressCreateScope`
 * and `@core/api/idempotency`.
 *
 * ## Serviceability is never computed here
 *
 * The client sends coordinates and renders a verdict. There is no distance check, no polygon, no
 * pincode allow-list and no cached "we serve Bengaluru" rule anywhere in this app.

     * bare "Phone no." field on a `phone-pad` whose own placeholder is "98765 43210". So the
     * value the design invites — ten national digits, optionally spaced — is exactly the value
     * the backend refuses, and every save that filled the optional receiver phone came back
     * `INVALID_REQUEST` with nothing on screen to explain which field was wrong. Verified
     * against the deployed API: `9876543210` -> 400, `+91 98765 43210` -> 400,

     * `toE164` is the SAME helper Login already uses for the number it sends to
     * `POST /v1/auth/otp/send`, so there is one normalisation rule in the app rather than two.
     * It only ever adds the prefix and strips separators — a number the customer typed with its
     * country code, and one the backend previously stored (already E.164, replayed by the edit
     * form), both pass through untouched.
     *
     * Placed on the transport boundary rather than in the screen so create, update and the
     * idempotency scope below all see the same bytes: an intent typed as "98765 43210" and
     * retyped as "9876543210" is one intent and reuses its key, instead of minting a second.

/**
 * The idempotency scope for a CREATE — the attempt's identity.
 *
 * ## Why the whole body, and not the point
 *
 * This scope used to be `address.create:<lat>,<lon>`. The coordinates are the one part of the
 * form the customer is LEAST likely to change between attempts, so the key survived exactly the
 * edits it should not have: a save that failed, a corrected flat number, and a retry that reused
 * the original `Idempotency-Key` with a different body. The backend is right to refuse that — a
 * key names one request, and answering a changed one from a stored response would be a lie — so
 * it returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`, and the screen is then stuck on a key it can neither reuse
 * nor rotate until the pin moves or the app restarts. Observed on the handset.
 *
 * Deriving the scope from the body inverts that: an UNCHANGED retry is byte-for-byte the same
 * intent and reuses the key (which is what makes recovery from an ambiguous timeout work — the
 * backend replays the original result rather than creating a second address), and ANY edit —
 * flat, building, label, receiver name, receiver phone, the point itself — is a different intent
 * and mints a new key.
 *
 * ## Why it is derived from `bodyOf`
 *
 * The identity has to be the identity of what is actually SENT. Reading the same function the
 * request body comes from is what keeps those two from drifting: a field added to the body
 * without being added here would silently become invisible to the scope, which is precisely the
 * bug this replaces.
 *
 * ## Stability
 *
 * Keys are SORTED, so the conditional spreads in `bodyOf` cannot change the scope by changing
 * the order in which optional fields appear. The pairs are JSON-encoded rather than joined with
 * a separator, so a value containing the separator cannot make two different payloads collide.
 * Nothing time-based, random or attempt-counted goes in: two identical submissions a minute
 * apart are the same intent and must produce the same key.
 *
 * The scope never leaves the device — `idempotencyHeader` maps it to a generated key and sends
 * only that — so its length is a local map-key concern and not a wire constraint.
