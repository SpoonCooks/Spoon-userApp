 * A saved address, back into the body `PUT /v1/me/addresses/:id` accepts.

 * The inverse of `savedAddressFrom`: that maps a stored row to what a screen draws, this maps it
 * to what a write sends. It exists because the API has no endpoint that flips a single field —
 * making an address the account default is a FULL REPLACE, so the record has to be replayed
 * whole with `isDefault` alongside it.
 *
 * Nullable columns become OMITTED optionals rather than nulls: `bodyOf` drops `undefined`, and
 * the backend's write schemas are `additionalProperties: false` with typed optionals, so an
 * explicit null is rejected.
 *
 * `receiverPhone` is replayed exactly as stored. It is already E.164 — the value the backend
 * accepted when it was written — and `bodyOf`'s `toE164` passes a number that already carries
 * its country code through untouched.
 *
 * Nothing here is computed or guessed. Every field is the server's own value, read back from the
 * list the screen is already rendering, which is what keeps a "make this my address" tap from
 * quietly rewriting the address it was meant to leave alone.
