 * Cook Pool — DEV PREVIEW, DEVELOPMENT ONLY. `spoon://cook-pool-preview` opens the landing for a
 * new household (`844:5842`); `?pool=1` opens it with two cooks already in the pool (`719:1507`).
 *
 * The real routes (`(app)/cook-pool/*`) sit behind the session guard, which a build with no live
 * backend cannot pass — the same reason `recurring-setup.tsx` sits outside `(app)`. The preview
 * therefore reads a local store seeded from `DEMO_COOK_POOL`, not `/v1/me/cooks`.
