/**
 * A hosted cook photo that fails to load falls back to the bundled one.
 *
 * `cook_photo_url` is untyped text on the backend with no validation anywhere, and nothing hosts
 * the images — so the URL is whatever operations pasted in. Until this, a non-null value had
 * already skipped the bundled tier by the time `<Image>` discovered it was dead, which left an
 * empty panel and made a BAD url strictly worse than no url: no url at least reached the bundled
 * cook.
 *
 * The distinction these pin is between ABSENT and FAILED. An absent photo is resolved upstream by
 * the adapters and never reaches the failure path; only a load error swaps the source.
