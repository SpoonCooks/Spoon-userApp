 * be quoted and cannot be shown an ETA, because every one of those reads takes an `addressId`.
 * Landing such a customer on Home leaves them looking at a header that says "Add address" beside
 * two tiles whose CTA can never enable - which is the state section 4 rejects.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, deliberately. A read that ERRORS answers `satisfied`, not `required`: a customer
 * whose address list failed to load still has their addresses, and redirecting them into
 * onboarding on the strength of a network error would hide real data behind a form that would
 * create a duplicate. Home surfaces the read failure itself.
 *
 * ## What "usable" means, now that the server says
 *
 * It used to be read as "no address at all", because the only signal available was `hub_id`, and
 * a null there means "not matched to a hub when last saved" - operational bookkeeping, not a
 * verdict. Treating it as unusable would have trapped a customer in onboarding the day a hub was
 * reconfigured, so it was recorded as a backend question instead of enforced.
 *
 * `GET /v1/me/addresses` now carries an EVALUATED `serviceability` verdict per row, computed at
 * read time against the live hub, society and gate rows. So the question can be asked properly,
 * and the distinction the contract draws is the one that matters here:
 *
 *   `serviceable`             - Spoon can cook there now.
 *   `temporarily_unavailable` - a hub polygon covers it, but the hub is paused. "Expected to
 *                               work again", in the contract's own words.
 *   `outside_service_area`    - "not a matter of waiting".
 *
 * Only the third is a reason to demand another address. A paused hub must NOT push anybody into
 * the address flow: the address is fine, the pause is temporary, and the map would refuse every
 * new pin in the same area anyway - which is the original trap wearing a different hat. So the
 * gate asks whether ANY saved address is something other than `outside_service_area`.
 *
 * The rule is the contract's semantics read back, not a client policy: nothing here computes
 * coverage, ranks hubs or looks at `hub_id`. If the server's verdict changes, this changes with
 * it and no release is needed.
