/**
 * The `Idempotency-Key` for a saved address must name the SUBMISSION, not the pin.
 *
 * The scope used to be `address.create:<lat>,<lon>`. Coordinates are the part of the form a
 * customer is least likely to change between attempts, so the key survived exactly the edits it
 * should not have: a failed save, a corrected flat number, and a retry carrying the ORIGINAL key
 * with a different body. The backend refuses that with `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` — correctly, since
 * a key names one request — and because the key is released only on success, the screen was then
 * stuck on a key it could neither reuse nor rotate. Reproduced on the handset before this fix.
 *
 * Both halves matter and they pull in opposite directions, which is why they are asserted
 * together: an UNCHANGED retry must reuse the key — that is the entire recovery mechanism for an
 * ambiguous network result — and ANY changed field must rotate it.
 *
 * That the screen still renders exactly as before is covered where it already was, by
 * `src/__tests__/routes.test.tsx`, which mounts this route and asserts its rendered tree.
