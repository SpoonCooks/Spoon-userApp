 * `POST /v1/me/addresses` / `PUT /v1/me/addresses/:id` — 201/200.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry with the LIST: the write response is a summary, not the full row, and it
 * carries the fulfilment verdict for the address it just saved. That verdict is stricter than
 * `POST /serviceability/check`: the check tests the hub polygon alone, while this also requires
 * the same active KML-backed hub. A Places ID is optional metadata; coordinates remain the
 * authoritative serviceability and fulfilment target.
 *
 * ## `label` is OPTIONAL, and that is the contract rather than a relaxation
 *
 * The two writes do not answer identically. `POST` echoes the label it stored; `PUT` does not —
 * its handler builds `{ id, receiverName, receiverPhone, placeId, latitude, longitude,
 * isDefault, serviceability }` and stops. The published contract agrees: `AddressWritten` marks
 * only `[id, isDefault, serviceability, latitude, longitude]` required, so a `label` that is
 * absent is a conforming response, not a truncated one.
 *
 * Requiring it here made every SUCCESSFUL update fail at the parse and surface to the customer
 * as a failed save, on top of a row the backend had already changed — the worst possible pairing,
 * because retrying re-sent a write that had already succeeded. Nothing meaningful is given up by
 * matching the contract: the label the app renders comes from `GET /v1/me/addresses`, which the
 * mutation invalidates, and no screen reads the label off the write reply.
