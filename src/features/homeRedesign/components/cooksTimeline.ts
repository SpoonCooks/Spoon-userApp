 * `1290:1280` — the "Cooks you can trust" stack, as Figma animates it on the hero's 8s loop
 * (`get_motion_context`, cards `1290:1905` / `1929` / `1949` / `1963`).
 *
 * The four cards rise in one after another, 17.5% of the loop apart. Each lands 70pt up from below
 * as it fades in; every card that lands after it pushes it 17.625pt further up and 5% smaller, so
 * the earlier cooks peek out above the newest one. Near the end the whole stack lifts 16pt and fades,
 * then snaps back below, hidden, for the next loop.
 *
 * Figma exports the four tracks separately; they differ only by when the card enters and how many
 * land after it, so they are built here from that one rule (pinned to the export in the test).
