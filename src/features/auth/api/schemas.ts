 *
 * ## Why the option ids are `z.string()` and not `z.enum([...])`
 *
 * Every single-select value is a canonical option id and the contract enumerates them, so an
 * enum would be the tighter transcription. It would also be the more BRITTLE one at exactly the
 * wrong moment: this schema parses `GET /v1/me`, which the boot gate reads before anything else
 * renders. A backend that adds a fifth household option would make that parse throw, and the
 * whole app would fail to open over a chip nobody selected.
 *
 * An unknown id costs nothing instead: `PreferenceGrid` matches selection by id, so a value no
 * chip carries simply draws none selected — the same as an unanswered question — and the next
 * save writes whatever the customer then picks. The canonical ids remain owned by `fields.ts`
 * (they are what is SENT); this end of the wire only has to survive what comes back.
 *
 * `grownUpEating` distinguishes `null` (never answered, or cleared) from `[]` (answered, then
 * emptied) and the contract keeps the two apart. The form cannot draw that difference — no chips
 * is no chips — so `detailsData.ts` collapses it for display only, and never on the way out.
