/**
 * The map step (`53:31`), as an interaction contract — task §26.
 *
 * ## The rule every test here defends
 *
 *   SELECTING a point is LOCAL.   CONFIRMING it is the only thing that asks the server.
 *
 * The screen used to run `POST /v1/serviceability/check` on every point it acquired — the device
 * fix on mount, a map tap, a moved pin, a chosen search result — and an `outside_service_area`
 * answer navigated the customer to `215:1472` from an effect. Two things fell out of that, and
 * both are asserted against below:
 *
 *   - exploring the map cost one request per gesture, so a customer comparing two sides of a road
 *     paid for it twice and the server was asked to rule on points nobody had chosen;
 *   - touching the wrong spot EJECTED them from the screen, which is why §5 opens with "that must
 *     stop".
 *
 * ## How a point is chosen now
 *
 * The pin is FIXED to the middle of the canvas and the customer drags the map beneath it, Rapido
 * style. So the coordinate comes from `onRegionChangeComplete` — the map coming to rest — and
 * never from a marker drop or from wherever a finger happened to land.
 *
 * The stub API rejects anything it was not given a handler for, so a serviceability call made at
 * the wrong moment fails the test loudly rather than passing silently.
