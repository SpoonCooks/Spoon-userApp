/**
 * UI-only view models.
 *
 * These describe what a COMPONENT renders, not what a server returns. No backend contract exists,
 * so every field below is marked with the confirmation it still needs. When the contract lands,
 * the mapping layer lives in the feature modules — these types do not move to `core/api`.
 *
 * Two rules held throughout:
 *  1. Nothing here is computed by the client. Amounts, ETAs, statuses, availability and
 *     eligibility arrive pre-decided and pre-formatted.
 *  2. No personally-sensitive value is a component input. In particular there is deliberately
 *     NO phone number anywhere in this file — the call action is a callback, so a component can
 *     never render, log or leak a number.
