/**
 * Feature: Recurring landing — the page that introduces recurring bookings and sends the customer
 * to plan them (the day picker, `recurringSetup`) or to build their Cook Pool first (`cookPool`).
 * It scrolls under a hero thread, offers its "schedule" button as a tag and then, once the tag has
 * scrolled away, as a sticky footer, and has an explainer video the customer can watch.
