 * apology card, and one the CUSTOMER cancelled is filtered downstream by `homeBannerFor`
 * (`cancelledBy !== 'system'` returns `null`, same as today) rather than by this function guessing

 *  - `GET /v1/me/bookings/active` -> whether the booking banner is drawn at all (ruling R-2)
 *  - `GET /v1/bookings/:id`  -> the cook, the timing and `allowedActions`, which the summary omits
 *  - `GET /v1/bookings/:id/tracking` -> the ETA, and ONLY while a cook is en route
 *  - `GET /v1/catalogue`     -> the instant arrival PROMISE behind "Spoon in 30 mins"
 *
 * `DEMO_HOME_ACTIVE_BOOKING` is no longer a data source. It is the static screen definition:
 * the promo panels, the two booking tiles, the cuisine mosaic, the reasons grid, the duration
 * matrix, the exclusions and the promise. None of that is domain state, and there is no endpoint
 * that serves it.
 *
 * PRODUCT_DECISION_PENDING: who owns that marketing content, and whether it should ever become
 * server-driven. Until that is answered it stays clearly static and clearly separate from the
 * domain reads above — which is what §18 asks for.
 *
 * Home renders as soon as the ADDRESS read settles. The active-booking read is additive: a Home
 * that is still fetching its booking shows the pre-booking variant rather than a spinner, which
 * is both faster and exactly what the design does when there is no booking.
